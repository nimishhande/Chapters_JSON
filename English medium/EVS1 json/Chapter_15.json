Different regions of Maharashtra get different amounts of rainfall. As\na result, there is variety in the crops grown. Agriculture is the main occupation\nin Maharashtra. Agriculture in the State depends mostly on rainfall. This is\ncalled rainfed (jirayati) agriculture. In some places, water obtained through\nirrigation is also used. This is called irrigated (bagayati) agriculture.\n\nThe agricultural season that falls during the monsoon period is called the\nkharif season and the one that falls during winter is called the rabi season.\n\n(96)\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nCan you tell » .\n\ne Study the map and complete the given activities.\n0 a M A D H Y A P\n\nOrHAyerxrwTsa\n\nMumps TELANGANA\nsarean\n\nMAHARASHTRA STATE\nMAJOR FRUITS AND\nCASH CROPS\n\nIndex\n\nFruits Cash Crops\n@\\ Mango ae Sugarcane\n@ Chikoo © Cotton\nWy Banana SF Turmeric\n@® Orange Y Vegetables\nQ Cashew- ® Onion\nq Grapes\n4 Coconut\n® Betel-nut\n\n60 120\nKilometres\n\n(1) Underline the names of districts which grow grapes.\n\n(2) Circle the names of cotton growing districts.\n\n(3) Circle the symbols of the crops grown in Thane and write their names in\nyour notebook.\n\n(4) In which districts is coconut an important crop?
