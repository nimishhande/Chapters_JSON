Directions and Maps\n\nCan you tell > 7\n\nGuess which picture is in which direction and complete the table.\n\n‘t 5\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nNow answer the questions given below.\n\n1. Which directions could you guess correctly?\n\n2. Which directions did you find it difficult to guess?\n\n3. Which are the main directions that you learnt last year?\n\nfo) Can you tell Ps\n\nThe pictures of the mountain, well, street lamp and fort are not towards the\nmain directions. Find out between which two main directions they are located\nand write your answer in the table below.\n\nSeeattemp\na\n\nMany things lie between two main directions. To determine the direction in\nwhich they lie, we use sub-directions.\n\ney Can you tell a\n\nStudy the following circle of directions and sub-directions carefully.\nNorth Note the sub-directions that lie\nNorth-west Nowth-cast between every . two adjacent main\ndirections. You will find that the name of\nevery sub-direction begins either with\n\nWest East .\n“ “ north or south. Now, look at the objects\ngiven at the beginning of the lesson once\nSouth-west South-east .\nagain. Check your answers and correct\nSouth\n\nthem if necessary.\n\nDraw the diagram showing the directions and sub-directions on a small card. It is known\nas the compass rose. We will use this compass rose later in the lesson.\n\n(82)\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nDo you know >»\n\nDirections are always\n\nparallel to the ground. That is\n\nwhy a map must always be\n\naligned to the local directions. eS\nThis makes it easier for <—\n\nus to understand the map and & “2\n\nthe region. =\n\n= A\n\na \\\nhw o, ood\n\nGUJARAT 7” 3” ! .\na? oo Amravati\n. : Dhule +, *\n\n;., Chandrapur 6\n' Gadchiroli ~, S\non. *\nAR,\n5  7u7G\n\n2\nTELANGANA }\n\nsora Pe gl MAHARASHTRA\nwel STATE\n\nState Boundary\nDistrict Boundary\n60 120 State Capital\n\nKilometres Second Capital\n\ne Use the compass rose made earlier to read the map given above.\n\n— Place the rose on Beed and make a list of all the districts that are situated\nalong the main directions and sub-directions.

These places are also large in size. Maps are comparatively\nquite small. Therefore, the distance between these places has to be shown\nin a very limited space on a map.\n\nWhen we draw\n\npictures of houses, i\n\nmountains and people, ic ate “Sr . ‘Yay\nwe draw them to fit Nee za a\n\nthe size of the paper Lit acrenaeal_ Maenuener OA\nwe are drawing on.

The distance\non the map is\nproportionate to the\ndistance on the ground.\nTry to understand this\nwith the help of the\npicture given here.\n\n. ™,\ney Use your brain power !\n\nThe distance between Rasika and Reshma’s houses is 10 kilometres (km).\nThe scale used on the map is 1 cm = 1 km. On the map, what would be the\ndistance between the two houses ?\n\n\\_£ 30 metres\n\nUsing a ruler, draw the distance in your notebook.\n\nAlways remember =>\n\n~\n\nDirections and sub-directions have been determined by man on the basis\nof the rising and setting of the sun. Thus, Nature can be our guide.\n\n(84)\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nWhat’s the solution\n\ne Ranjana and Julie are going on a picnic. They want to go from their\nresidence to a garden.
