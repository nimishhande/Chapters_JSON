  "content": "--- Page 1 ---\nCee ecceeecccceerccccecrcccceesccceerccccoee\n\nYou have learnt the mathe-\nmatical operations of addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication and\ndivision. You can do sums which\ninvolve any one or more of these\noperations. You may also solve\ncomplicated sums which involve\nall of these operations. You can\ncalculate the answers quickly if\nyou use tables. But sometimes,\nit is necessary to carry out very\ncomplicated calculations that\ninvolve very large numbers. At\nsuch times, mistakes are bound to\noccur in the calculations. Then you\nwaste a lot of time checking and\nrechecking your answers. How can\nwe avoid these errors and wastage\nof time?\n\nA computer is a machine that\nis an answer to all these problems.\nComputers can solve problems\nand carry out the most difficult\ncalculations with amazing speed\nand accuracy.\n\nPeer eeeecccrecccereccccrerecccereeccerererererererereceeeeeoeeD\n\n23. Computers\n\nCee ecceeeccccercccecercccceecccceescceeereceeeceoeeeeceeD\n\nseveral\n\ncan do\nother things besides carrying out\ncalculations. In fact, there are few\nthings that a modern computer is\nnot able to do.\n\nComputers\n\nComputers have memory.\nThat is, they can store a lot of\ndata or information. They can\nkeep words, pictures and sounds\nin their memory and give you the\ninformation within a fraction of a\nsecond when you need it.\n\nComputers can process the\ndata or the information according\nto the instructions given to them.\nA modern computer can follow\nthousands of instructions within\na fraction of a second. Only,\nthe instructions have to be given\nin a language that the computer\nunderstands. A set of code\ninstructions written for a computer\nis known as a program. Writing a\ncomputer program is a specialized\ntask.\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nA computer on its own does not make judgements about\nthe instructions given to it. It follows the instructions blindly.\nThat is why, the instructions have to be written very very\ncarefully. The instructions must cover every step involved\nin an operation. If you miss a step, the computer will not\ncorrect it.\n\nOne has to think carefully to imagine every step involved\nin any task. Let us see if we can imagine all the steps involved\nin a simple task. Suppose mother has asked you to buy\nvegetables. You have to divide this task into smaller ones —\n\n(1) Going to the greengrocer’s shop,\n(2) Picking up the vegetables you want and paying for them,\n(3) Coming back home.\n\nThen you have to subdivide these tasks into still smaller\nones. For example -\n\n(1) Going to the greengrocer's shop\n\nTake a bag for the vegetables. Take money for the vegetables.\n\nCross the street.\nEnter greengrocer's shop.\n\nEach of these smaller tasks can again be divided further\ninto even smaller tasks. Try to do that choosing any one of\nthe above steps.\n\nThus, we see that computers are smarter than men, but it\nis men who do the difficult job of making them smart enough.\n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nSo the next time you play a game on a computer, or watch a\nvideo or obtain some information, think of the men who put in so\nmany efforts to make it all possible.\n\nThings FO GO 2 Pecercecccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccescccccscccescessesseseesscseeseesesseesessesseseeses\n\n1. Read the sentence and choose the correct alternative.\n(a) Mistakes are bound to occur.\n(1) There are no mistakes.\n(ii) There are some mistakes.\n\n(111) All mistakes are tied together.\n(b) There are few things that a modern computer is not able to do.\n(1) A modern computer can do a few things.\n(ii) A modern computer cannot do a few things.\n(iii) A modern computer can do almost everything.\n\n2. List the mathematical operations mentioned in the passage.\nUsing your mathematics textbook, write one example of each operation.\n\n3. Do you make mistakes in your calculations ?\nWhat do you do to correct them ?\n\n4. What do you do to remember the information you have gathered ?\n\n5. Choose any home assignment you have been given.\nWrite a detailed set of instructions for completing that assignment.\n\n6. List all the words related to computers that you find in this passage.\n\nFind and add more words to the list.",
